# Flipper: WASM dApp for Astar

This is a demo for a simple WASM contract. The contract name is Flipper. 
Flipper contract has two method. 
1. One transaction method `flip` 
2. One query method `get`. 

Flipper contract is meant to show a `hello world` use case for WASM, Swanky and connect the contract via a React frontend.

The `contract` folder contains the contract code. The `UI` folder contains the UI code. UI is written in Next.js and React.
<!-- 
# Requirements

- node.js
- swanky cli https://github.com/AstarNetwork/swanky-cli
-->
# Usage

Install swanky cli https://github.com/AstarNetwork/swanky-cli
```bash
npm install -g @astar-network/swanky-cli@1.0.7
```

### Deploy the Flipper contract

0. Init

```bash
cd contract
swanky init flipper
```
and chose `ink` as a contract language and `flipper` as template and a chosen contract name. Chose `Y` when asking to download the Swanky node.

1. Start the local node

```bash
cd flipper
swanky node start
```
Then swanky node starts running in your local environment.

2. Build the contract

Open new tab
```bash
swanky contract compile flipper
```
(Try rustup update if you face error which Swanky doesn't return error)

3. Deploy the contract

Local
```bash
swanky contract deploy flipper --account alice -g 100000000000 -a true
```

Shibuya
```bash
swanky contract deploy flipper --account alice --gas 100000000000 --args true --network shibuya
```
Copy paste the contract address.

### Run the UI

Install Dependencies

```bash
cd ../..
yarn
```

Start Next.js server

```bash
yarn dev
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 and enter the contract address. Flip button flips the boolean value.

### Note when running Swanky node:

Example is set up to connect to Shibuya network. If you want to connect to local environment, you need to change the setting in app.tsx file in ui/components:

```txt
// local
// const WS_PROVIDER = 'ws://127.0.0.1:9944'

// shibuya
const WS_PROVIDER = 'wss://shibuya-rpc.dwellir.com'
```

Also, you need to add predefined [Substrate Developer Accounts](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/keyring/start/suri/#dev-accounts) to your browser extension so you can sign the flip() call with Alice account existing on Swanky node. 

You can find instructions how to do that in this [article](https://mirror.xyz/0x4659B666AC0e8D4c5D1B66eC5DCd57BAF2dA350B/bGFJYZhxBojZd0Dx6DEo8OifrJgIwNxwQ4CITWixUZw)
